\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents solutions to problems encountered in the implementation of policy classes for SystemVerilog constraint layering. Policy classes provide portable and reusable constraints that can be mixed and matched into the object being randomized. There have been many papers and presentations on policy classes since the original presentation by John Dickol at DVCon 2015. The paper addresses three problems shared by all public policy class implementations and presents a solution to a fourth problem. The proposed solutions introduce policy class inheritance, tightly pair policy definitions with the class they constrain, reduce the expense of defining common policies using macros, and demonstrate how to treat policies as disposable and lightweight objects. The paper concludes that the proposed solution improves the usability and efficiency of policy classes for SystemVerilog constraint layering.
\end{abstract}

\section{Constraints and Policy Class Review}

When working with randomized objects in SystemVerilog, it is typically desired to control the randomization of the item being randomized. The common method of doing so is by using constrained random value generation. Constraints for the randomization of class properties can be provided within the class definition, which will require randomized properties to always pass the specified constaint check. For example, the following \code{addr_txn} class contains a constraint on the \code{addr} property to ensure it is always word aligned.

{\begin{svcode}
class addr_txn;
    rand bit [31:0] addr;
    rand int        size;

    constraint c_size {size inside {1, 2, 4};}
endclass
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{A basic address transaction class}}

Constraints can also be provided outside the class definition at the point of randomization by using the \code{with} construct. This allows variation to the constraints based on the context of the randomization. For example, the same \code{addr_txn} class can have an instance of it randomized with the following constraint on its \code{data} property.

{\begin{svcode}
addr_txn txn = new();
txn.randomize() with {addr == 32'hdeadbeef;};
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{En example of an inline constraint}}

Policy classes are a technique for SystemVerilog constraint layering with comparable performance to traditional constraint methods, while additionally providing portable and reusable constraints that can be mixed and matched into the object being randomized, originally presented by John Dickol \cite{b1}\cite{b2}. This is possible through SystemVerilog ``Global Constraints'', which randomizes all lower-level objects whenever a top-level object is randomized, and solves all rand variables and constraints across the entire object hierarchy simultaneously. A summary of his approach can be found by examining the following code.

\svfile{example_code/v1_original_policies/policy_base.svh}{The \code{policy_base} and \code{policy_list} classes}

These first two classes provide the base class types for the actual policies. This allows different, related policies to be grouped together in \code{policy_list} and applied to the randomization call concurrently. Both of these classes are parameterized to a specific object type, so separate instances will be required for each class type that needs to be constrained.


\svfile{example_code/v1_original_policies/addr_policies.svh}{Policies for constraining the \code{addr_txn} class}

The next three classes contain implementations of the \code{policy_base} class for the \code{addr_txn} class. A list of valid address ranges can be stored in the \code{ranges} array. The \code{addr_permit_policy} will choose one of the ranges at random and constrain the address to be within the range, while the \code{addr_prohibit_policy} will exclude the address from randomizing inside any of the ranges in its list.


\svfile{example_code/v1_original_policies/addr_txn.svh}{The \code{addr_txn} class and a constrained subclass}

The final two classes show how these policies are used. The \code{addr_txn} class creates a \code{policy} queue, and during the \code{pre_randomize} function sets the handle to the \code{item} object within each policy to itself. The \code{addr_constrained_txn} subclass adds two policies to a local \code{pcy} list, one that permits the address to be within one of two ranges, and one that prohibits the address from being within a third range. The \code{addr_constrained_txn} class can then passes the local \code{pcy} list to the parent \code{policy} queue.

At this point, an instance of \code{addr_constrained_txn} can be created and randomized like normal, and the address will be constrained based on the policies provided.

{\begin{svcode}
addr_constrained_txn txn = new();
txn.randomize();
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{Randomizing an instance of \code{addr_constrained_txn}}}

Further work on policy-based constraints has been presented since the original DVCon presentation in 2015. Kevin Vasconcellos and Jeff McNeal applied the concept to test configuration and added many nice utilities to the base policy class \cite{b3}. Chuck McClish extended the concept to manage real number values for User Defined Nettypes (UDN) and Unified Power Format (UPF) pins in an analog model \cite{b4}. Additionally, he defined a policy builder class that was used to generically build multiple types of policies while reducing repeated code that was shared between each policy class in the original implementation.

Although there has been extensive research on policies, this paper aims to address and provide solutions for three issues that have not been adequately resolved in previous implementations. Furthermore, a fourth problem that arose during testing of the upgraded policy package implementation will also be discussed and resolved.

\section{Problem \#1: Parameterized Policies}

The first problem with the above policy implementation is that because policies are specialized using parameterization to the class they constrain, different specializations of parameterized classes cannot be grouped and indexed. This is most apparent when creating a class hierarchy. If you wanted to extend a class and add a new field to constrain then you need a new policy type. The new policy type requires an extra policy list to modify any new attributes in the child class and requires the user to know which layer of the class hierarchy defines each attribute they want to constrain. Imagine a complex class hierarchy with many layers of inheritance and extension, and new constrainable attributes on each layer (one common example is a multi-layered sequence API library, such as the example presented by Jeff Vance \cite{b5}). Using policies becomes cumbersome in this case because you need to manage a separate policy list for each level of the hierarchy and know what each list can and cannot contain. For example, extending the \code{addr_txn} class to create a version with parity checking results in a class hierarchy that looks like this:

\svfile{example_code/v2_extended_txns/addr_txn.svh}{Modified address transaction classes with a parity checking subclass  and policies included}

This class ends up with a lot of boilerplate code and is not very intuitive to use. The user needs to keep track of what the difference is between each policy list and apply constraints properly. Each additional subclass in a hierarchy will cause the constrained class to grow further. The solution to this problem is to replace the parameterized policy base classes with a combination of a policy interface class and a parameterized policy implementation class. 

\svfile{example_code/v3_extended_policies/policy_base.svh}{The \code{policy} interface class and \code{policy_imp} class}

By abstracting the policy functionality into an interface class, all policy implementations under a common base class are given compatibility with each other and can be stored in a shared policy queue. The \code{uvm_object} class is a good base class when using policies within UVM, as it will likely cover every class you will be randomizing. If working with another framework, a reasonable base class will need to be chosen. Because the \code{set_item} function no longer receives a parameterized type input, the input needs to be cast to the implementation type. If this cast fails, the item is set to null and randomization is disabled. 

\svfile{example_code/v3_extended_policies/addr_policies.svh}{Address policies updated to use the new policy implementation}

The address policies are updated to inherit from \code{policy_imp} parameterized to the relevant transaction class. Additionally, the constraints are updated to verify the internal item handle is not null.

\svfile{example_code/v3_extended_policies/addr_txn.svh}{Address transaction classes updated to use the new policy implementation}

The new address transaction classes are simplified considerably. Only a single policy queue is required in the class hierarchy, and the constraint block does not need to keep track of any specialized lists. The \code{addr_txn} class now subclasses \code{uvm_object} to provide compatibility with the policy interface.


\section{Problem \#2: Definition Location}

The second problem is ``where do I define my policy classes?'' This is not a complicated problem to solve, and most users likely place their policy classes in a file close to the class they are constraining. However, by explicitly pairing policy definitions with the class they constrain, users never need to hunt for the definitions or guess where they are located, and the definitions are given an appropriate and consistent home in the environment. This is done by embedding a \code{POLICIES} class inside the class being constrained. This class acts as a container for all relevant policies and allows policies to be created by simply referencing the embedded class through the \code{::}operator.

\svfile{example_code/v4_embedded_policies/addr_txn.svh}{Address transaction classes with embedded policies}

In the above code, there were few changes from the previous iteration. All the policy classes were migrated into an embedded \code{POLICIES} class, and a static constructor was created for the parity policy to simplify its creation. The parity \code{POLICIES} class was set as a child of the initial \code{POLICIES} class, which further simplified the usage of the classes in the constraint block. Finally, policies in the constraint block are accessed through the \code{addr_constrained_txn::POLICIES::} accessor.

\section{Problem \#3: Boilerplate Overload}

The third problem is that policies are relatively expensive to define since you need at a minimum, a class definition, a constructor, and a constraint. This will be relatively unavoidable for complex policies, such as those defining a relationship between multiple specific class attributes. For generic policies, such as equality constraints, range constraints, or set membership (keyword \code{inside}) constraints, macros can be used to drastically reduces the expense and risk of defining common policies. The macros are responsible for creating the specialized policy class for the required constraint within the target class, as well as a static constructor function that is used to create new policy instances of the class. Additional macros are utilized for setting up the embedded \code{POLICIES} class within the target class. These macros can be used hand in hand with the non-macro policy classes needed for complex constraints, if necessary.

\svfile{example_code/v5_policy_macros/policy_macros.svh}{Macros for setting up the embedded \code{POLICIES} class and a fixed value policy}

The \code{start_policies}, \code{start_extended_policies}, and \code{end_policies} macros replace the embedded \code{class POLICIES} and \code{endclass} statements within the constrained class. They set up class inheritance as needed and create a local typedef for the \code{policy_imp} parameterized type. The \code{fixed_policy} macro wraps two additional macros responsible for creating the policy class and a static constructor for the class. In this example, a policy class that lets you constrain a property to a fixed value is defined.

\svfile{example_code/v5_policy_macros/addr_txn.svh}{Simplified address transaction classes using the policy macros}

The base \code{addr_txn} class has complex policies with a relationship between the \code{addr} and \code{size} fields, so rather than creating a policy macro that will only be used once, they can either be left as-is within the embedded policies class, or moved to a separate file and included with \code{`include} as was done here to keep the transaction class simple. The child parity transaction class is able to use the \code{`fixed_policy} macro to constrain the \code{parity} field. The constraint block remains the same as the previous example.

\section{Problem \#4: Unexpected Policy Reuse Behavior and Optimizing for Lightweight Policies}

A fourth problem we noticed in our initial usage of policy classes was occasional unexpected behavior when attempting to reuse a policy. It is hard to quantify and we never spent time to create a reproducible test case, but some of the policies behaved like they ``remembered'' being randomized when used repeatedly and wouldn't reapply their constraints during subsequent \code{randomize} calls. Rather than spending time to find an exact diagnosis of the issue, we were focused on transitioning our policy approach to a ``use once and discard'' approach, where we would treat a policy as disposable and model them as extremely lightweight classes. This change happened to solve the randomization issue as well.

We expected that we would need hundreds or thousands of policies per test, so we aimed to minimize the memory requirements and streamline functionality as much as possible. To minimize the footprint of policies, we chose to implement them as simple classes rather than extensions of \code{uvm_object}. We duplicated some useful capabilities such as a basic copy routine, while omitting more expensive functionality such as factory compatibility or object comparison. The buggy randomization behavior implied we needed to pass in fresh policy instances each time we randomized an object. Two features helped to accomplish this: static constructor functions and a \code{copy} method.

{\begin{svcode}
static function addr_parity_policy FIXED_PARITY(bit value);
    FIXED_PARITY = new(value);
endfunction
...
pcy.push_back(addr_constrained_txn::POLICIES::FIXED_PARITY(1'b1));
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{Example static constructor function from the \code{FIXED_PARITY} policy class}}

Using static functions to create new instances of the policies provides an easy way to create and use a policy with a single function call. The policy is created and immediately pushed onto the policy queue, then discarded and recreated the next time it is needed.

{\begin{svcode}
interface class policy;
    ...
    pure virtual function policy copy();
endclass: policy
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{Example static constructor function from the \code{FIXED_PARITY} policy class}}


Adding a \code{copy} method to the policy classes provides a way for a policy to return a fresh copy of itself with the same configuration. This is useful when a policy needs to be reused multiple times. The policy can be copied and pushed onto the policy queue multiple times, or onto other policy queues, and each copy will constrain the field separately. The \code{copy} method is \code{pure virtual}, so it must be implemented by each policy class.

After migrating to this pattern of reuse, the issues we were seeing with unapplied constraints disappeared.

\section{More Improvements to the Policy Package}

The examples presented so far are functional, but are lacking many features that would be useful in a real-world implementation. The following examples will present additional improvements to the policy package that will make it more practical efficient to use.

\subsection{Expanding the \code{policy} interface class}

The following \code{policy} interface class adds additional methods for managing a policy.

\svfilerange{../policy_pkg/policy.svh}{4}{18}{Expanded \code{policy} interface class}

The \code{name}, \code{description}, and \code{copy} methods are implemented by the policy (or policy macro) directly and provide reporting information useful when printing messages about the policy to the log for the former two, or specific behavior for making a copy for the latter. The remaining three methods are implemented by \code{policy_imp} and are shared by all policies. 

\subsection{Better type safety checking and reporting in \code{policy_imp} methods}

Some of the benefits of above methods can be seen by examining the new \code{set_item} method used by \code{policy_imp}.

{\begin{svcode}
virtual function void set_item(uvm_object item);
    if (item == null) begin
        `uvm_error("policy::set_item()", "NULL item passed")

    end else if ((this.item_is_compatible(item)) && $cast(this.m_item, item)) begin
        `uvm_info(
            "policy::set_item()",
            $sformatf(
                "policy <%s> applied to item <%s>: %s",
                this.name(), item.get_name(), this.description()
            ),
            UVM_FULL
        )
        this.m_item.rand_mode( 1 );

    end else begin
        `uvm_warning(
            "policy::set_item()",
            $sformatf(
                "Item <%s> type <%s> is not compatible with policy <%s> type <%s>",
                item.get_name(), item.get_type_name(), this.name(), this.type_name()
            )
        )
        this.m_item = null;
        this.m_item.rand_mode( 0 );
    end
endfunction: set_item
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{\code{set_item} method from \code{policy_imp}}}

The \code{set_item} method makes use of all the reporting methods to provide detailed log messages when \code{set_item} succeeds or fails. Additionally, the \code{item_is_compatible} is used before the \code{\$cast} method is called and the \code{rand_mode} state is kept consistent with the result of the cast.

\subsection{Replacing \code{policy_list} with \code{policy_queue} and \code{policy_container}}

Eagle-eyed readers might have noticed the lack of presence of a \code{policy_list} class in any of the examples above after migrating to the improved policy interface. Rather, a single typedef is all that is necessary to manage policies in a class.

{\begin{svcode}
typedef policy policy_queue[$];
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{}}

The \code{policy_queue} type is capable of storing any policy that implements the \code{policy} interface. The default queue methods are sufficient for basic usage, but by introducing another interface class, the direct management of the queue can be abstracted away from the user.

\svfilerange{../policy_pkg/policy_container.svh}{4}{22}{The \code{policy_container} interface class}

This interface class should be implemented by any class that needs to manage a policy queue. The method implementations can then be used to manipulate a policy queue as needed, including adding to, replacing, or clearing the queue, and returning a handle to the queue or a copy of the queue to use elsewhere.

\subsection{Creating a \code{policy_container} base class implementation}

The \code{policy_container} interface class allows for a base class implementation that can be used to manage constraints across the entire class hierarchy. 

\svfilerange{../policy_pkg/policy_object.svh}{4}{55}{A \code{policy_object} base class implementation}

This base class implements all the \code{policy_container} functionality. Treating it as a mixin allows you to apply it to different categories of transactions.

{\begin{svcode}
class base_txn extends policy_object #(uvm_sequence_item);

class base_seq #(type REQ=uvm_sequence_item, RSP=REQ) extends policy_object #( uvm_sequence#(REQ, RSP) );

class cfg_object extends policy_object #(uvm_object);
\end{svcode}
\captionof{figure}{Example classes using the \code{policy_object} base class}}

Each of these classes will contain a separate policy queue, but each will share an API and can be used in the same way. The \code{policy_object} base class can be used as a mixin to any class that needs to manage a policy queue.

\subsection{Protecting the policy queue}

A subtle but significant additional benefit to using a base \code{policy_object} class along with the \code{policy_container} API is the ability to mark the container's policy queue as protected and prevent direct access to it. 

The original implementation called \code{set_item} on each policy during the \code{pre_randomize} stage. That was necessary because the \code{policy_queue} was public, so there was nothing to prevent callers from adding policies without linking them to the target class.

Using an interface class and making the implementation private means the callers may only set or add policies using the available interface class rountines, and because those routines are solely responsible for applying policies, they can also check compatibility (and filter incompatible policies) and call \code{set_item} immediately. This can be seen in the example \code{policy_object} implementation above, in the usage of the protected function \code{try_add_policy}.

By calling \code{set_item} when the policy is added to the queue, all policies will be associated with the target item automatically, so there is no need to do it during \code{pre_randomize}. This eliminates an easily-overlooked requirement for classes extending \code{policy_object} to make sure they call \code{super.pre_randomize()} in their local \code{pre_randomize} function.

\section{Conclusion}

The improvements to the policy package presented in this paper provide a more robust and efficient implementation of policy-based constraints for SystemVerilog. The policy package is now capable of managing constraints across an entire class hierarchy, and the policy definitions are tightly paired with the class they constrain. The use of macros reduces the expense of defining common policies, while still allowing great flexibility in any custom policies necessary.

The complete policy package is available in Appendix \ref{policy_pkg}, with additional macro examples available in Appendix \ref{policy_macros}. A functional package is also available for download \cite{b6} which can be included directly in a project to start using policies immediately.

% Please observe the conference page limits.

% \section{Ease of Use}

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins,
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document.
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%     \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%     \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%     \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables,
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
%     a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

%     {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files.

%     {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3.

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%     \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%     \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%     \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%     \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%     \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%     \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%     \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%     \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%     \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%     \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B.
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
